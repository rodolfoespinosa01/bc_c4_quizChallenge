# Project Title
## Generate Password Homework Challenge

## Description
This is a quiz that was created from scratch. The goal was to make the quiz appear similar to the mockup provided. Once the startQuiz button is clicked a timer is suppose to start at the top right. If any questions are answered wrong then 10 seconds should be deducted. If any questions are answered correctly, we are suppose to add to the current score the user has. If the timer ends before the user finished the quiz, then the quiz should end automatically. Once the quiz ends we are suppose to allow the user to enter their initials and submit their score. All scores submitted and saved in the local stoarge should appear in a list. There is also a goBack and ClearHighScore button.
